# Matlab_Refrigeration
Matlab code for an Refrigeration lab from 2021

This lab involved collecting data from a cooling system. Sensors supplied the raw data and we used Excel and Matlab to clean, analyze, and visualize the data.

The matlab file 'fridgelab.m' is the main script that cleans, analyzes, and visualized the data. Other accompanying datasets, scripts, and files are supplementary.

Here is a link to the presentation we did covering the lab: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CW7eW2BWldWx7apgL2W2rxJUuTHTryCT
